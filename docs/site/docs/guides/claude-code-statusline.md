# Claude Code statusline

OpenUsage can render a one-line status bar for [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code), shown at the bottom of the editor. It summarizes the model, your session and today's cost, the active 5-hour billing block, the burn rate, and how full the context window is — all from your local conversation logs, with no network call by default.

```
🤖 Opus 4.8 | 💰 $12.40 sess / $6.79 today / $3.40 block (2h41m left) | 🔥 $1.20/hr | 🧠 96k (48%)
```

:::note
Costs are **API-equivalent estimates** derived from your local logs, not your subscription charge. The session figure is the whole conversation's lifetime; "today" is across all your Claude Code sessions since local midnight.

## Install

The fastest path is the interactive installer. On a terminal, run:

```bash
openusage statusline install
```

This opens a one-screen, **live-preview configurator** (the same style as `openusage tmux install`). Toggle which segments you want, flip the options, and watch the preview update; press **enter** on **Apply** to write it into `~/.claude/settings.json` (your previous settings are backed up to `settings.json.bak`).

```
Configure your Claude Code statusline

preview 🤖 Opus 4.8 | 💰 $12.40 sess / $6.79 today / $3.40 block (2h41m left) | 🔥 $1.20/hr | 🧠 96k (48%)

  [x] Session cost
  [x] Today's cost
  [x] 5h block cost + time left

  Color          ‹ on ›
  Pricing        ‹ embedded (instant) ›
  [ Apply ]

↑/↓ move · ←/→ change · space toggle · enter apply · q cancel
```

Then **restart Claude Code** (or open a new session) so it re-reads `settings.json`.

## What each segment shows

| Segment | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Model name | `🤖 Opus 4.8` | From the session Claude Code pipes in. |
| Session cost | `$12.40 sess` | The whole conversation's API-equivalent cost. |
| Today's cost | `$6.79 today` | All Claude Code spend since local midnight. |
| 5h block | `$3.40 block (2h41m left)` | The active 5-hour billing block and time remaining. |
| Burn rate | `🔥 $1.20/hr` | Spend rate for the active block. |
| Context % | `🧠 96k (48%)` | Tokens in the context window vs. the model's limit; turns yellow then red as it fills. |

## Customize

Everything the configurator sets can also be passed as flags — useful for scripting or for editing the `command` in `settings.json` directly.

```bash
# Only show today's cost and the context gauge:
openusage statusline install --segments today,context

# Drop color (e.g. for a terminal that mishandles ANSI), keep all segments:
openusage statusline install --color=false

# Fetch live pricing instead of the embedded table (slightly slower):
openusage statusline install --offline=false
```

Passing any of `--segments`, `--color`, `--offline`, or `--mode` makes the install non-interactive and bakes those choices into the installed command.

Other flags:

- `--context-medium <pct>` / `--context-high <pct>` — thresholds where the context gauge turns yellow / red (defaults: 50 / 80).
- `--mode calculate|display|auto` — `calculate` (default) recomputes cost from tokens and local pricing; `display` uses the cost Claude Code reports; `auto` prefers logged cost and falls back to calculation.

## Manual configuration

If you'd rather edit `~/.claude/settings.json` by hand, add a `statusLine` block. The installed command carries your options as flags:

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "openusage statusline --segments today,context",
    "padding": 0
  }
}
```

A bare `openusage statusline` (no flags) shows every segment in full color.

## Uninstall

```bash
openusage statusline uninstall
```

This removes only the OpenUsage `statusLine` block (it leaves a third-party statusline alone) and backs up the file first.
