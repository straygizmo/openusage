# Install

OpenUsage is a single Go binary. CGO is required (it links SQLite for the telemetry store), so all distribution channels ship pre-built binaries.

## macOS — Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew install janekbaraniewski/tap/openusage
```

Upgrade later with:

```bash
brew upgrade openusage
```

:::warning Homebrew 6.0+ tap trust
Homebrew 6.0 requires third-party taps to be explicitly trusted. Installing
with the fully-qualified name above trusts only that one formula version, so a
later `brew update` that bumps OpenUsage can leave the keg installed but
**unlinked** — `openusage` then reports `command not found` until you run
`brew link`.

Trust the whole tap once so OpenUsage stays linked across every upgrade:

```bash
brew trust janekbaraniewski/tap
```

If you already hit the unlinked state, re-link the current keg with:

```bash
brew link janekbaraniewski/tap/openusage
```

See the [Homebrew Tap Trust docs](https://docs.brew.sh/Tap-Trust) for details.
:::

## macOS & Linux — install script

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/janekbaraniewski/openusage/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
```

The script picks the right binary for your OS/arch and drops it into `/usr/local/bin/openusage` (or another writable directory in your `PATH`).

:::note Windows
This is a POSIX shell script — it runs on Windows only under WSL or Git Bash. For native Windows (PowerShell / cmd), see [Windows](#windows) below.
:::

:::tip
Read the script first if you prefer:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/janekbaraniewski/openusage/releases/latest/download/install.sh | less
```

## Pre-built binaries

Download a release archive directly from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/janekbaraniewski/openusage/releases) and put `openusage` somewhere on your `PATH`.

Available targets:

- `darwin-amd64`, `darwin-arm64`
- `linux-amd64`, `linux-arm64`
- `windows-amd64`

## Windows

Windows is a supported target — CI builds and tests on `windows-latest`, and every release ships a prebuilt `windows-amd64` binary. There is no native install script or package manager (`brew`, scoop, and winget are not used), so install one of these ways:

**Prebuilt binary (recommended)**

1. Download `openusage_<version>_windows_amd64.zip` from the [releases page](https://github.com/janekbaraniewski/openusage/releases). `windows-amd64` is the only prebuilt Windows target — there is no Windows arm64 build.
2. Extract `openusage.exe` and move it to a directory on your `PATH`.
3. Confirm it works:

   ```powershell
   openusage version
   ```

**From source**

`go install` (see [below](#from-source-go-125)) also works on Windows, but CGO is required, so you must have a C toolchain — install **MinGW-w64** or **MSYS2** and make sure `gcc` is on your `PATH` before running it.

:::note Daemon on Windows
`openusage telemetry daemon install` sets up a launchd (macOS) or systemd (Linux) service and has no Windows service equivalent. On Windows, run the dashboard in direct mode (just `openusage`) instead.
:::

## From source (Go 1.25+)

```bash
go install github.com/janekbaraniewski/openusage/cmd/openusage@latest
```

`CGO_ENABLED=1` must be on (it is by default on macOS and most Linux distros). On systems without a C toolchain, install one first:

- macOS: `xcode-select --install`
- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install build-essential`
- Fedora: `sudo dnf install gcc gcc-c++`
- Arch: `sudo pacman -S base-devel`
- Windows: install MinGW or MSYS2

## Verify

```bash
openusage version
```

You should see the version number, the commit, and the build date. If the command isn't found, make sure the install location is on your `PATH`.

## Start the daemon

The daemon is the runtime that polls providers, ingests hooks, and persists data to SQLite. The TUI reads from it. Install it once with:

```bash
openusage telemetry daemon install
```

This sets up a launchd agent (macOS) or a systemd user unit (Linux) and starts the service. See the [Daemon overview](../daemon/overview.md) for what it does and how to manage it.

:::note CGO and cross-compilation
OpenUsage embeds [`mattn/go-sqlite3`](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3) for the telemetry store, which requires CGO. Cross-compiling needs a target-specific C toolchain; most users should grab the pre-built binaries from the release page instead.
